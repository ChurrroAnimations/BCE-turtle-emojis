# BCE-turtle-emojis
The files for the turtle emojis for my Discord server, the Bale of Chelonian Enthusiasts(BCE). **[Please join!](https://discord.com/invite/kjmqZKqJFb)**

For the turtle with Emojis on them, I use [Pine Tools' Overlay images online](https://pinetools.com/overlay-images), and used [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) for the images. I the image size to 35%.

For the rest that I made, I just used a background remover online.

Also run the .sb3 file in Turbowarp. It uses custom extensions, hence why I'm not uploading it to Scratch
